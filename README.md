- ### Design

  This is a game is displayed in the terminal so the design options are very limited. However, I used an external library that allowed me to add colors and emojis. Thanks to this, the game is legible and more player-friendly

  - #### Colour Scheme

  Colors used: yellow, blue, purple, green and red.

## Code Organisation

## Data Validation

## Testing

### Further Testing

- The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Opera and Safari browsers.
- The Safari browser doesn't support 'smooth' behavior parameter in window.scroll() method.
- The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop (Macbook Pro 16 inch), Mobiles( Huawei P20 Mate, Huawei P30, Samsung S21 ultra).
- A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.
- Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

    - create a new Heroku app
    - Set the buildpacks to 'Python' and 'NodeJS' in that order
    - Link the Heroku app to the respository
    - Click on 'Deploy'

### Forking the GitHub Repository

By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Izabela88/brainstorm-quiz)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page), just above the "Settings" button on the menu, locate the "Fork" button.
3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

### Making a Local Clone

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Izabela88/brainstorm-quiz)
2. Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
4. Open Git Bash
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
6. Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
```

7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
